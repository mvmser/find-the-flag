## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Running Locally

```

## 🌐 Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Automatic Deployment

The app is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment workflow:

1. Builds the project using `npm run build`
2. Uploads the built files to GitHub Pages
3. Makes the app accessible at `https://mvmser.github.io/find-the-flag/`

### Manual Deployment

You can also trigger a deployment manually:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Local Build

To build the project locally:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

### Base Path Configuration

The project is configured to deploy to a subdirectory (`https://mvmser.github.io/find-the-flag/`) with the base path set in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/find-the-flag/', // Match your repo name
  // ...rest of config
})
```

### Auto-Update Functionality

The application includes an automatic update detection system that ensures users always have the latest version:

#### How It Works

1. **Service Worker Updates**: The service worker checks for updates every 60 seconds
2. **Cache Versioning**: Each deployment increments the cache version, forcing cache invalidation
3. **Update Notification**: When a new version is detected, a notification banner appears at the top of the page
4. **One-Click Update**: Users can click "Update Now" to reload the app with the latest version

#### Version Management

The app version is displayed in the footer of the home page and should be incremented with each pull request. When incrementing the version, you need to update it in **three places**:

1. **Update `package.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.4.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Update the version constant in `src/components/HomePage.tsx`**:
   ```typescript
   const APP_VERSION = '0.4.0';
   ```

3. **Update the service worker cache versions in `public/sw.js`** (increment the suffix number):
   ```javascript
   const CACHE_NAME = 'find-the-flag-v2';
   const IMAGE_CACHE_NAME = 'find-the-flag-images-v2';
   ```
   
   **Note:** The cache version suffix (e.g., `v2`, `v3`, etc.) is independent of the app's semantic version number. It should be incremented sequentially with each deployment, regardless of whether the app version bump is a patch, minor, or major update. This ensures that users always receive the latest assets and that old caches are properly invalidated.
   
   Example: When updating from v0.4.0 to v0.5.0, change `v2` to `v3`:
   ```javascript
   // Before (v0.4.0)
   const CACHE_NAME = 'find-the-flag-v2';
   const IMAGE_CACHE_NAME = 'find-the-flag-images-v2';
   
   // After (v0.5.0)
   const CACHE_NAME = 'find-the-flag-v3';
   const IMAGE_CACHE_NAME = 'find-the-flag-images-v3';
   ```

**Version Increment Guidelines:**
- **Patch version** (0.4.x): Bug fixes, minor UI tweaks, translation updates
- **Minor version** (0.x.0): New features, settings additions, game mode enhancements
- **Major version** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, complete redesigns, major feature overhauls
